# salt-php
Saltstack states to set up PHP on a server.

## Usage

Add these to your saltstack states:

    git submodule add https://github.com/cebe-cc/salt-php.git salt/php
    
The states are independent of their actual location in the state file tree, so you may replace `salt/php` with a location of your choice.
